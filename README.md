# Face Detection Application with OpenCV

A face detection application that was made for introduction to OpenCV in Java.

## What I Learned

* Fundamentals about computer vision, why it is harder than supervised learning
* Theory of Viola-Jones Algorithm, Haar-features, Boosting Algorithm and Cascading
* Usage of setLookAndFeel method in Swing library
* Implementation of video capture in Java

### How To Use

1. The application was written in Eclipse IDE. You can download it from this link:
https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2018-12/r/eclipse-ide-enterprise-java-developers

2. Download and extract the OpenCV folder to local harddrive (ie. C:/OpenCV320) and add its bin folder to PATH in Environment Variables. You can find additional information from this link:
https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction

3. Add Jar file of OpenCV library to the project. For additional information:
